## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the `=` (equals) operator do in JavaScript?
  The `=` is an assignment opperator. It is used to assign values to variables.
- What operator will return the data type of a variable value?
  typeof (I think it's interesting that typeof doesn't use camel case)
- Which keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
  let, const, or var(only for old browsers)
- Which characters is a JavaScript variable allowed to begin with?
  letters '$' or '\_'
- What are quotation marks used for in JavaScript?
  Quotation marks are used to denote a string. You can use single or double quotation marks or backticks. Backticks allow you to use quotation marks within the string. They also honor line breaks and you can use ${...} to include previously declared variable values within the string.
- What is the purpose of strings in JavaScript?
  Strings are used to store and manipulate sequences of characters. These can be any character(s) included in the unicode standard.
- What is the purpose of booleans in JavaScript?
  Boolean expressions have 1 of 2 values of which include truthy or falsy values. Truthy values can be 1, true, or yes while falsy values can be 0, false, or no.
- What is the purpose of numbers in JavaScript?
  Numbers store numerical data. These values can be used to perform math functions.
- What does `null` mean in JavaScript?
  Null means there is a deliberate absence of value. It is different from "undefined", as the undefined value indicates a value could exist but has not been indicated yet. So, if you have a const variable with a value of null, there will never be a value for that variable. It's worth mentioning that the statement "null == undefined" is true.
