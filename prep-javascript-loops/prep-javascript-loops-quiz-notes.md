## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  If the conditional expression is true, the code block will be executed.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  When the loop begins, it is evaluated only once before the conditional expression.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  It is evaluated after the initialization and after the code block has been executed or after the final expression if it exists.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  If it exists, this expression is executed every time after the code block is executed.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  This usally changes the variable in the conditional expression.
